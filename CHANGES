		version 0.4
		- merged in changes of github.com/shattered/macro11
		- added option "-listhex" to generate listings in hex instead of octal
		  (helpful for work with modern logic analyzers).
		- bugfix: 

2009.04.19: JH
		version 0.3
		- bugfix: Illegal labels and illegal opcodes are processed as
		  "implied .WORD" directives.
		  Expression errors in "do_word()" did not process any input character,
		  so parser did go into an endless loop.
		- Switchable syntax extensions with -yxx options:
		  symbol len can be adjusted with "-ysl" command line option.
		  "-yus" option allows underscore "_" char in symbols.
		  This was needed to process code generated by my favorite disassembler.
		- command line help added (-h option)

2009.04.17: JH
		version 0.3
		- ".INCLUDE" re-enabled
		- refactoring: big 6000+ lines "macro11.c" split into 10 modules.
